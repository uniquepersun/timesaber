# timesaber
what's this? <br>
---
a bot to create time.cs50.io links for meetings easily right from slack; <br>
I will not define it as laziness but rather smartness yeaa :p

## How this works?
see the [demo.md](https://github.com/uniquepersun/timesaber/blob/main/demo.md)

## Setup
clone this repo, make a virtualenv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
then, you need to put bot token and signing secret in a `.env` file see [envexample.txt](https://github.com/uniquepersun/timesaber/blob/main/envexample.txt) <br>
and then, since I've have made a `dockerfile` so either you can build the image and run it in docker or run the `app.py` :v:
